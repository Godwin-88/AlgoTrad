//Function Definition:
//long Fibonacci(long n): This function takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
//Base Cases:
//The function has two base cases:
//If n == 0, it returns 0 (the first number in the Fibonacci sequence).
//If n == 1, it returns 1 (the second number in the Fibonacci sequence).
//Recursive Case:
//If n is greater than 1, the function calls itself recursively as Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2).
//This is the key part of the Fibonacci sequence definition, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

    return 0;

	// N = 30000??
}
//Variable Declaration:
//int N = 40;: This sets the number of Fibonacci numbers to compute to 40.
//For Loop:
//The loop runs from n = 0 to n < 40.
//In each iteration, it calls the Fibonacci(n) function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number and prints it, followed by a comma.
//Return Statement:
//return 0;: This indicates that the program has executed successfully.
//Commented-Out Code:
// N = 30000??: This is a comment suggesting the idea of calculating the 30,000th Fibonacci number, but itâ€™s commented out.
//Recursive Function Explanation
//Recursive Nature:
//The function uses a classic recursive approach to calculate Fibonacci numbers. For each call to Fibonacci(n), the function calls itself twice: once to compute Fibonacci(n-1) and once to compute Fibonacci(n-2).
//Efficiency:
//This recursive approach is straightforward but inefficient for large values of n because it involves a lot of redundant calculations. For example, Fibonacci(40) will recursively calculate Fibonacci(38) twice, Fibonacci(37) multiple times, and so on, leading to exponential time complexity.
//This inefficiency makes it impractical to compute very large Fibonacci numbers, like Fibonacci(30000), using this method. The comment // N = 30000?? suggests the idea of computing such a large Fibonacci number, which would be extremely slow and could cause stack overflow errors due to deep recursion.
